                  <li>At the time, object recognition was machine learning based, with relatively smaller image datasets (like CIFAR)</li>
                  <li>This paper came about after the creation of larger, more granular datasets like ImageNet and LabelMe</li>
                  <li>CNN's were employed in order to learn features from 1000s of types of objects, for millions of images</li>

                  <li>It's worth noting that CNN's have far fewer connections and parameters to standard NNs, so they are easier to train with only a slightly worse theoretical best performance</li>
                  <li>
                     This paper proposes an implementation of (for the time) an extremely large CNN, powered by GPU parallelization and a highly optimised version of 2D convolution

                  ImageNet is a dataset of over 15 million labeled high-resolution images belonging to roughly 22,000 categories
               </li>
               <li>
                  The ILSVRC (ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge) uses a subset of ImageNet with roughly 1000 images in each of 1000 categories. In all, there are roughly 1.2 million training images, 50,000 validation images, and 150,000 testing images
               </li>
               <li>
                  Results were reported on both the 2010 ILSVRC dataset (which had test labels available) and the 2012 version of the same (test set labels were unavailable)

                     ImageNet consists of variable-resolution images, while the CNN requires a constant input dimensionality.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     The images were hence downsampled to 256x256. Given a rectangular image, the image was first rescaled such that the shorter side was of length 256, and then the central 256x256 patch was cropped out.

                  <li>
                     Based on some of Hinton's prior work, the ReLU function [f(x) = max(0,x)] was adopted as the activation function -- this non-saturating nonlinearity was much faster than saturating non-linearities like tanh and sigmoid. (<a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/174295/what-does-the-term-saturating-nonlinearities-mean">Ref</a>)

                  <li>
                     The model was trained on multiple GPUs -- with half the neurons on each GPU. Certain kernel maps only took inputs from their own GPU, while some did across GPUs. This was decided via cross-validation. This scheme reduced top-1 and top-5 error rates by 1.7% and 1.2%, respectively as opposed to training a network of half the size on one GPU.

                     The authors also mention that ReLUs have the desireable property that they don't require input normalisation to prevent them from saturating. However, it was found that normalisation did indeed reduce top-1 and top-5 error rates by 1.4% and 1.2%. They used a non-trainable layer that square-normalized the pixel values in a feature map within a local neighborhood. The normalisation occured across color channels

                     Pooling layers in CNNs summarize the outputs of neighboring groups of neurons in the same kernel map. The authors chose to use overlapping pooling, which reduced the top-1 and top-5 error rates by 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively in comparison to the non-overlapping configuration.

                     Data Augmentation via the extraction of random 224x224 patches, and their horizontal reflections + altering the intensities of RGB channels (PCA on pixel values, and adding multiples of the principal components.
                     e perform PCA on the set of RGB pixel values throughout the ImageNet training set. To each training image, we add multiples of the found principal components, with magnitues proportional to the corresponding eigenvalues times a random variable drawn from a Gaussian with mean zero and standard deviation 0.1. This scheme approximately captures an important property of natural images, namely, that object identity is invariant to changes in the intensity and color of the illumination. This scheme reduced the top-1 error rate by over 1%.

                     Dropout, then recently introduced, consists of setting to zero the output of each hidden neuron with probability 0.5. The neurons which are “dropped out” in this way do not contribute to the forward pass and do not participate in back- propagation.

                     At test time, we use all the neurons but multiply their outputs by 0.5, which is a reasonable approximation to taking the geometric mean of the predictive distributions produced by the exponentially-many dropout networks.

                        The authors investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy in a large-scale image recognition setting.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        The primary objective was to improve on the work by Krizhevsky et al. (2012) and achieve better accuracy rates
                     </li>

                     <li>
                         Their main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3 × 3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16–19 weight layers
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        These findings were the basis of the authors' ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively
                     </li>

                  Their main contribution were ConvNet architectures that not only achieved the state-of-the-art accuracy on ILSVRC classification and localisation tasks, but were also applicable to other image recognition datasets, where the models achieved excellent performance even when used as a part of a relatively simple pipelines (like as feature extractors to SVMs)

                     <li>
                        During training, the input to the ConvNet is a 224x224 image (normalised by subtracting the mean per pixel)
                     </li>
                     <li> 
                        Image is passed through a stack of convolutional layers (with conv filters with a 3x3 receptive field) -- 1x1 receptive fields are also used at a point, which is essentially a linear transformation. The stride is 1 pixel
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Spatial pooling is performed via MaxPool (<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-max-pooling-in-convolutional-neural-networks">ref</a>) layers, over 2x2 pixel windows with stride 2 -- this is after some of the conv layers, not all
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </section>

                     <li>
                        All the layers use a ReLU activation function
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        None of the networks except for one used LRN, and the authors inferred that the use of LRN did not carry a specific benefit during training (contrary to what the folks over at UToronto figured out!)
                     </li>

                     <li>
                        The authors demonstrate the benefits of smaller receptive fields, over the course of the larger number of layers - this incorporates more non-linear rectification layers making the decision function more discriminative, while also reducing the # of params
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        The use of 1x1 conv filters created an increasingly non-linear decision function without affecting the receptive fields of the convolutional layers (the additional non-linearity is introduced by the ReLU)

                         The batch size was set to 256, momentum to 0 .9. The training was regularised by weight decay, and the LR was dropped by a factor of 10 when the validation accuracy stopped improving.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Learning was stopped after 370K iterations (74 epochs) -- the nets required less epochs to converge due to (a) implicit regularisation imposed by greater depth and smaller conv. filter sizes; (b) pre-initialisation of certain layers.

                        The weights of the net weren't always randomly initialised. The shallowest net was first trained, and then those weights for those layers were used as starting points for the deeper nets

                        Two approaches were considered: single-scale training with a fixed S, and multi-scale training, where S was selected from a range of [256, 512] -- this can be viewed as scale jittering, and was incorporated by fine-tuning a model trained on single-scale data

                        The ConvNet architecture uses an interesting inference process -- involving the conversion of the net to a fully convolutional NN (referred to as dense evaluation)
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Upon inference, the FC layers are converted to convolutional layers, and the resulting fully convolutional net is used to optain a class-score map, with (# of channels = # of classes)
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Finally, to obtain a fixed-size vector of class scores for the image, the class score map is spatially averaged (sum-pooled: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37434426/max-pooling-vs-sum-pooling#:~:text=Sum%20pooling%20works%20in%20a,inputs%20instead%20of%20it's%20maximum.&text=Sum%20pooling%20(which%20is%20proportional,pattern%20in%20a%20given%20region.">ref</a>).

                     <li>
                        Since the fully convolutional NN is applied to the whole image, there's no need to sample multiple crops -- the authors claim that this is far more efficient. However, they also point out that sampling multiple crops could lead to a performance gain

                     <li>
                        For single scale evaluation (no scaling at test time), jittering at training time resulted in better results. This indicated that augmentation via jittering is indeed helpful for capturing certain image charecteristics across scales.

                        Scale jittering at test time was also evaluated, and the results were found to be even better than those without jittering at test time

                        This consists of running a model over several rescaled versions of a test image (corresponding to different values of Q), followed by averaging the resulting class posteriors.

                        It was demonstrated that the representation depth is beneficial for the classification accuracy, and that state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet challenge dataset can be achieved using a conventional ConvNet architecture (LeCun et al., 1989; Krizhevsky et al., 2012) with substantially increased depth.

                  Architecture
               </section>
               <section>
                  In general, an Inception network is a network consisting of Inception modules of the above type stacked upon each other, with occasional max-pooling layers with stride 2 to halve the resolution of the grid.
               </section>
               <section>
                  A useful aspect of this architecture is that it allows for increasing the number of units at each stage significantly without an uncontrolled blow-up in computational com- plexity at later stages.

               <section>
                  Given relatively large depth of the network, the ability to propagate gradients back through all the layers in an effective manner was a concern. The authors rectify this by adding auxillary classifiers to intermediate layers. This is aimed to This was thought to combat the vanishing gradient problem while also providing regularization.

                   These classifiers take the form of smaller convolutional networks put on top of the out- put of the Inception (4a) and (4d) modules. During training, their loss gets added to the total loss of the network with a discount weight (the losses of the auxiliary classifiers were weighted by 0.3)

                  For both classification and detection, it is expected that similar results could be achieved by much more expensive non-Inception CNNs of similar depth and width. However, this approach shows us that moving to sparser architectures could be a feasible and useful idea in general.
