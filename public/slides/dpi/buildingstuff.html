          <section>You don't have to conquer the world with a few lines of code -- what you do need to do, is identify a very specific and well defined problem</section>

          <section>Okay sure, but how do I actually do this?</section>
          <section>Think of an idea. <br /><br />It could be something that annoys you on a day-to-day basis, a change that you feel you could spark in the environment around you, or just a really cool game :)</section>
          <section>Identify your <a href="https://www.inc.com/guides/2010/06/defining-your-target-market.html">target market</a> - who wants to use your idea?</section>
          <section>Reach out to your target market.<br /><br />Talk to people. Cold email them. Set up Zoom calls. Agree on a pre-defined set of questions that you want answered. <b>Validate</b> that the people who you <b>think</b> have a problem, actually do.</section>
          <section>Keep in touch with them. They'll probably end up being your first users.</section>
