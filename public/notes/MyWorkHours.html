<h1>I work weird hours, please don't feel rushed to reply</h1>
I work whenever suits me the best. Sometimes, this includes early mornings, late nights, and the weekends. This is <b>not at all</b> indicative of any sense of urgency. I'm just working when convenient for me :)

Do whatever works best for you. Trust me, I'm doing the same too.

PS - if you want to chat about this, just ask and I'd be glad to clear anything up!
