<h1>I work weird hours, you don't have to</h1>
I work whenever suits me the best. Sometimes, this includes early mornings, late nights, and the weekends. This does <b>not</b> mean that you are under any compulsion to do the same. We encourage people to work when suits them the best, and for people to block time away from work as well.

Do whatever works best for you. Trust me, I'm doing the same too :)

PS - if you want to chat about this, just ask and I'd be glad to clear anything up!
